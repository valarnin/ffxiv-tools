# IMPORTANT: This array is extremely important and must be updated
# whenever Lutris or its FFXIV wine runtime introduces new environment
# variables, otherwise there will be plenty of bugs with the launched
# game (such as delayed sound, glitches), or it may not launch at all.

# To find the exact list of environment variables that Lutris itself
# is INTENTIONALLY setting when the game is launched, just open
# a terminal and run the following:
#
# "lutris -d"
#
# Then start XIVLauncher inside Lutris GUI. There will be lots of
# debugging information in the terminal. All of the required variables
# will be listed there, in the following format:
#
# "DEBUG    2022-01-09 09:00:23,918 [command.start:139]:DXVK_NVAPIHACK="0""
#
# Simply copy the variable names from each line, such as "DXVK_NVAPIHACK",
# and update the array below.
#
# But the easiest and most reliable way to produce the list of variables
# is by copying all of the "command.start" lines into a text document,
# and then running the following regex replacement on it:
#
# - Search: `^DEBUG    .+? \[command.start:139\]:(.+?)=.+?$`
# - Replace: `    "\1"`
#
# (Don't include the surrounding backticks: `.)
#
# That regex will automatically create perfectly formatted lines for you.
#
# NOTE: The environment may still contain a few other variables which
# aren't listed in Lutris debug, but those probably aren't set by Lutris
# and most likely comes from Wine and the OS itself, so technically
# we probably don't need to include anything other than what Lutris sets.
#
# ALSO NOTE: Unfortunately, we'll only capture the user's CURRENT values,
# but won't react if they later change some of the game settings in Lutris.
# However, since most people play the game with default Lutris settings,
# this risk won't affect most people.
